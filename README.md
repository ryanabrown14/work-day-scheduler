# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Moment.JS, and Bootstrap.  It displays the current date at the top of the page using moment.JS. As the day progresses the time sheet will highlight different times based on if the the time has passed, is right now or in the future.  Any thing you type in the schedule can be saved by pressing the blue button on the side of the page.

## Project Status
Everything seems to be in working order.  I'm sure there is a better way to pull the saved content from local storage, this can be changed as I get more comfortable.
